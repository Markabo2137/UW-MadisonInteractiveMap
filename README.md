# UW-MadisonInteractiveMap


## Project 3 from CS400: Group of 8 -> 2 subgroups of 4 containing...
* Data Wrangler (Me) > created the locations.gv file of a mock graph in DOT format and created java classes to parse through the .gv file
* Algorithm Engineer > created the graph data structure with associated funtions and implemented kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree
* Backend Developer > integrated info from locations.gv file into graph
* Frontend Developer > created a command loop for the user - command line interaction


### Description
An interactive user - command line map that loads a graph of some of UW-Madison's buildings from a .gv file (building distances/weights and locations are not based on reality) and uses kruskal's algorithm to find
                    shortest path's between buildings.. 

#### Demo run:

### Capabilities
* Load info from a DOT structured graph file
* Add/remove buildings (nodes)
* Add/delete roads (edges)
* Find the shortet path between two buildings
* Find and print the minimum spanning tree to reach all buildings in graph
* View all buildings with where you can get to and from, and at what distance (cost/weight)
